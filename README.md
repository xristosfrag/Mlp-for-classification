# MLP Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) as part of an assignment for a CSE course at the University of Ioannina. The aim of the assignment was to implement an MLP from scratch using Java and evaluate its performance on a dataset.

### Contents
* Assignment.pdf: Contains the assignment prompt and specifications.
* NetworkNeurons.java: Contains the implementation of the MLP in Java.
* Report.pdf: Contains the report for the assignment, including an analysis of the implementation and the results obtained.

### Usage
To use the implementation, simply download the NetworkNeurons.java file and incorporate it into your Java project.

### Acknowledgements
We would like to thank our professor 'Aristidis Likas' for the guidance and support provided during the course of this assignment.
