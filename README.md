# MLP Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) developed as part of an assignment for a course in computer science and engineering department at the University of Ioannina in 2022. The aim of the assignment was to implement an MLP from scratch using Java  and assess its performance on a custom dataset.

### Contents
* Assignment.pdf: Contains the assignment prompt and specifications.
* NetworkNeurons.java: Contains the implementation of the MLP in Java.
* Report.pdf: Contains the report for the assignment, including an analysis of the implementation and the results obtained.

### Usage
To use the implementation, simply download the NetworkNeurons.java file and incorporate it into your Java project.
